## Fake Your Database

Some of the scariest code to test can sometimes be your database dependency. Rather than let that stop you, letâ€™s walk through some powerful ways to fake your database dependency to quickly and efficiently test code next to it.

In this workshop, we will:

* Create a new ASP .NET Core API project.
* Add an API to get data a pre-existing database
* Add a service project
* Add a model project
* Add a postgres service project
* Connect to a pre-provisioned postgres database
* Add a test project
* Add provider tests which fake the database.

## Creating the Database

This was done before the workshop, but for the sake of transparency, these were the resources used:

* http://www.postgresqltutorial.com/postgresql-sample-database/
* http://www.postgresqltutorial.com/load-postgresql-sample-database/
* https://tableplus.io/blog/2018/04/postgresql-how-to-create-read-only-user.html

The exact scripts will be added to [./data](./data)
